# To do list

## `oas2ro`

- [ ] make imports a Set

## `oas2tb`

Looks okay for now.

## Core

- [ ] Write files to a temp directory, then delete target and rename temp to avoid deletes on failure. Build a graceful shutdown function that takes an error and call it instead of directly throwing errors.

## Other schema testing

## Prepare

- [ ] build and deploy to npm
